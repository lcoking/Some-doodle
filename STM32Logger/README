This is a firmware project for the STM32 microcontroller.
 Intended for medical datalogging, but the basic framework could be extended
for other uses.
 Based on ST-Eval um0424 example code combined with the micro SD spi mode 
access code from the FatFS example project by Elm-Chan.
 Device presents itself as a USB mass storage device, allowing logged files
to be copied off the FAT32 formatted memory card on SPI1. Also controls a lipo
charger and bluetooth module on USART1 - more features to be added in future.
